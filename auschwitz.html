                The Book "The Books keeper in Auschwiz" is one of the book that i have never heard before. Originaly it was written in Spanish
                 The books is talking about the children's block in Auschwitz. Personaly, it's the first book that i read about the children's block.
                The main characte is a girl - Dita who is a very brave girl, who decided to keep and hide the books for the school they had there. Dita passed the death camp and stayed alive.
                 The main aim was to keep kids as far from the camp horrors as as far as possible, by creating a school right in the midst of Holocaust. "The Books keeper in Auschwiz" has a reference to a famous, due to her diary whitch was published, girl Anna Frank that Dita met in Auschwitz at the end.

              The book clearly discribes the feelings,atmosphere, fear. This book makes you on your toes, every single page.
              Definitely, the best book i have read about the children's blok in Auschwiz.
