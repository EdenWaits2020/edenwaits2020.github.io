                        <p2 align="left">  "The Scarlet Sky" is the best book about the II World War, which took place in Italy.
                          The book is based on a tue story about the guy Pino from Milan, who was living his normal teenage-life with his friemds and have never ever thought what they will experience in 1 year, when the war will start.
                          Basicaly, the book can be divided into 5 main parts: 1-Pino's peacefull life with his parents in the center of Milan, having laxury apprtmnet and their own brand of leather bags. 2- Beginning of the war and Pino helps jews to ascape from nazi accupation in Italy though the Alps.3- Pino joins nazi army and accidentely becomes a persoal driver for one of the most important general in Nazi army, a man who is Hitlers right hand in Italy. 3- Pino joins resistance army and starts spy on the general Lerens and give all the information to the resistance army. 5- the significant plot twist.
                          Pino is an incredible guy who helped hundreds of Jews to run away from Nazi though Alps to Switzerland. Though out the book we see how Pino's character is changing, how he becoms a Man. The book is very versatile. Love, friendship, brotherhood, family bounds, horror of war, deaths, Holocaust....
                          Even after a month, i still can't start reading a new book, because all my thoughts are still in "The Scarlet Sky".
