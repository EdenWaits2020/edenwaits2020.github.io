                  <p1 align="left"> Hello, my name is Eden Anna. Since I was 15 I have been collecting my own library.
              Now I have more than 250 books in it.
              The first book from which my journey started was “ To kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee.
              And my library is not just a collection of book, it’s a collection of the greatest minds' ideas and lives. I buy them and borrow them from my friends and my friends borrow their books for me; so we have a small reading club. I think that if a person says that he doesn’t like reading, he just hasn’t found a correct book. There are a lot go benefits that books can offer you. That's the true magic that our brain and books can do together. The moment when the story, no matter how strange has some semblance of the truth and you can believe it. Just think for a minute, you can download the mindset of people who were the smartest, the wisest, the most intelligent representative of mankind. It’s a hidden treasure. I can talk to the scientist, doctors and just amazing writers, who are did much more than I did, every day. And all of them are in my home, they are in my library. By reading good classic books, which I adore, I can see what people did in a certain situation, and in what it turned out at the end. So books teach wisdom and help to avoid a certain situation, or helps to understand people around more.
              A book is not a one-time event, but a friend, with whom you can talk over and over again. There are a lot of benefits that books can offer you.They increase your brainpower, vocabulary, memory, writing skills, imagination, and creativity.
