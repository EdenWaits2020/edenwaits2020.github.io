                  <p1 align="left"> Hello, my name is Eden Anna. Since I was 15 I have been collecting my own library.
            Now i have more than 300 books in it, which i bough and wrote reviews on them. I believe, that books can place a person to a complely different world and give knowlende, experience, examples from the smartest and wisest people who walked the earth.
            Thus it's extremely importan not to loose an opportunity to talk to all these writes who wanted to share their lives with us.
            Do not loose that! My reviews are on the II World War mostly and all the issues it caused within Europe and America.
